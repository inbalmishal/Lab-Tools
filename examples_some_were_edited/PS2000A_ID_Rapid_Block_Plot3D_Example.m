%% PicoScope 2000 Series (A API) Instrument Driver Oscilloscope Rapid Block Data Capture Example
% This is an example of an instrument control session using a device
% object. The instrument control session comprises all the steps you are
% likely to take when communicating with your instrument.
%       
% These steps are:
%    
% # Create a device object   
% # Connect to the instrument 
% # Configure properties 
% # Invoke functions 
% # Disconnect from the instrument 
%
% To run the instrument control session, type the name of the file,
% PS2000A_ID_Rapid_Block_Plot3D_Example, at the MATLAB command prompt.
% 
% The file, PS2000A_ID_RAPID_BLOCK_PLOT3D_EXAMPLE.M must be on your MATLAB
% PATH. For additional information on setting your MATLAB PATH, type 'help
% addpath' at the MATLAB command prompt.

% *Example:*
%     PS2000A_ID_Rapid_Block_Plot3D_Example;

% *Description:*
%     Demonstrates how to set properties and call functions in order to
%     capture data in rapid block mode from a PicoScope 2000 Series
%     Oscilloscope using the underlying 'A' API library functions.

% This example was published using the following test signal:

%% Set channels
% Default driver settings applied to channels are listed below - use
% |ps2000aSetChannel()| to turn channels on or off and set voltage ranges,
% coupling, as well as analog offset.

% In this example, data is only collected on channel A so default settings
% are used and all other channels are switched off.

%% Verify timebase index and maximum number of samples
% Use the |ps2000aGetTimebase2()| function to query the driver as to the
% suitability of using a particular timebase index and the maximum number
% of samples available in the segment selected then set the |timebase|
% property if required.
%
% To use the fastest sampling interval possible, enable one analog
% channel and turn off all other channels.
%
% Use a while loop to query the function until the status indicates that a
% valid timebase index has been selected. In this example, the timebase
% index of 42 is valid.

% Initial call to ps2000aGetTimebase2() with parameters:
%
% timebase      : 42 (320 ns for a PicoScope 2208A)
% segment index : 0
